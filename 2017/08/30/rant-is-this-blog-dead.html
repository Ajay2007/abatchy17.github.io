No new posts for a while now, wtf is going on?<br /><br />Well, I started a <a href="https://twitter.com/abatchy17/status/883517803080294402">new role</a> a couple of months ago and I didn't have much time to blog (I still kind of don't), but now that security is my full time job, I have the luxury of working on topics I enjoy at work AND at home. That also means I can utilize my time better to work on things I want to do, not need to do.<br /><br />Like what? Two things, participating in CTFs and doing OSCE.<br /><br />Participating in CTFs has been on my list for quite sometime, and it's about time I get serious about it. Will I just participate in CTFs? No, I'd prefer to blog about challenges same way I did with VulnHub VMs. It's just my way of learning things, when I need to explain things to others I have to understand it properly.<br /><br />During the upcoming weeks I will be writing walkthroughs for <a href="https://2017game.picoctf.com/">PicoCTF 2017</a>, probably a post per topic/level or something. Unlike most CTF writeups, these posts will be super noob-friendly, no jumping into answers, instead demonstrate techniques on how to approach problems in each category, provide some recommended reading material and such. A rough estimate to cover all these challenges would be 24 weeks or so.<br /><br />What about OSCE? Well I was planning on doing it in July but won't be able to commit to it. Goal is still to tackle it by end of 2017 (fingers crossed).<br /><br />/rant<br /><br />- Abatchy
