_Rooted Phoenix, Barry, Hotline, Core and Timeclock!_  
  
As some of you know, I started PWK course last Saturday. Received the e-mail
exactly at 4:00PM, spent a couple of hours checking out the material and
setting up the VM and decided to root some machines!  
  
Focused on Linux machines as I'm more comfortable working on them, I managed
to root 5 machines on my first day. Will focus on Windows VMs a little.
