_**Note:** This post summarizes the techniques discussed in Corelan [post](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/23/writing-buffer-overflow-exploits-a-quick-and-basic-tutorial-part-2/) on jumping to shellcode. Read it for better understanding._  
  
So you managed to control EIP and you want to jump to your shellcode. Check the condition for each technique and see if you can make it work to reach your shellcode.  
  

### 1\. `JMP`/`CALL` register

**Conditions:**
* A register points to shellcode. 
 
**Example:** 
* `[Register]` → `[Shellcode]` 
* `EIP` → `JMP/CALL [register]`  
* `EIP` now points to `[register]` where shellcode.  

**Pros:**
* Easy to apply.  
* Common instruction.  

**Cons:**
* None.

### 2\. `POP RET` / `POP POP RET` / `POP POP POP RET`

**Condition:**
* Address at `[ESP+4]`, `[ESP+8]`, `[ESP+12]` (and so on) points to address to shellcode **OR** directly to shellcode. 
   
**Example 1:** 
* `[ESP]` → `[4 bytes][Address to shellcode]`.
* `EIP` → `POP [register]` followed by `RET`.  
    * `POP [register]`: `ESP` now points to `old_ESP + 4`
    * `RET`: `EIP` now contains address to shellcode.  
* `EIP` now points to shellcode.  
   
**Example 2:** 
* `[ESP]` → `[8 bytes][Address to JMP ESP][shellcode]`.  
* `EIP` → `POP [register]` followed by `POP [register]` followed by `RET`:  
    * `POP [register]`, `POP [register]` will get rid of 8 bytes, `new ESP` → `old ESP + 8` (Address to `JMP ESP`)  
    * `RET` places address to `JMP ESP` in `EIP` and now `ESP` now points to shellcode.  
    * `JMP ESP`: `EIP` now contains `ESP`
* `EIP` points to current ESP value which points to start of shellcode.  

**Pros:**
* Straightforward (slightly harder than method 1).  
* Lots of possible combinations to find instruction.  

**Cons:**
* Less frequent pattern.

### 3\. `PUSH  RET`

**Condition:**
* A register points to shellcode and can't/don't want to use method 1.

**Example:**
* `[Register]` → `[Shellcode]`  
* `EIP` → PUSH [register], followed by `RET`  
  * Stack will first push register, then pop it to `EIP`.   
* `EIP` now points to shellcode.  

**Pros:**
   * Easy to apply.  
   * Fallback if method 1 can't be done.  
   
**Cons:**
    ○ None.

### 4\. JMP [register + offset]

**Condition:**
* A register + offset points to shellcode.  

**Example:**
* `[Register]` → `[Shellcode]`  
* `EIP` → `JMP [register + offset]`
* `EIP` will point to `[register + offset]` where the shellcode starts.  

**Pros:**
* Easy to apply.  

**Cons:**
* Doesn't work if `[register + offset]` points to address to shellcode as `ESP` doesn't change and a `RET` won't work.  

---

### 5\. Blind return

**Condition:**  
* Shellcode is always loaded to the same address.  
* Address doesn't contain a null byte.  
* You control at least the first 4 bytes at `[ESP]`
  
**Example:**  
* Shellcode is always at `0xdeadbeef`
* Since you control the first 4 bytes at `ESP`, put `0xdeadbeef` at `ESP`.  
* By pointing `EIP` to a `RET`, address at `ESP` will be popped to `EIP`.  
* `EIP` now points to address `0xdeadbeef` where the shellcode starts.  

**Pros:**  
* Easiest method, only need a RET.  
* Fixed address.  

**Cons:**  
* Heavy dependency on hardcoded address.  
* Address can't contain null byte (good luck with stack at low address).  
* Assumes no ASLR and/or DEP.

### 6\. `POPAD`

**Condition:** 
* Shellcode is located at `[ESP + 32x + offset]`  
* Enough controllable space to execute `POPAD` y times then `JMP ESP`.  

**Example:**
* `[ESP + 240]` → `[Shellcode]`  
* `[ESP + 32 * 7]` → `[NOP sled]` 
* `[ESP] → POPAD 7 times followed by `JMP ESP`  
* `EIP` → `[JMP ESP]`
    * `EIP` will execute `POPAD` 7 times, `ESP` = `old_ESP` + 224  
    * `EIP` goes over `NOP sled`  
    * `EIP` after executing `NOP sled`, it will point to `[ESP + 240]` where the shellcode starts.  
    
**Pros:**  
* `POPAD` is a single byte.  
* `ESP` gets incremented with 32 every time POPAD is executed.  

**Cons:**
* Requires NOP sled.  
* Less reliable than Method 1/2/3/4

### 7\. Short jumps (backwards, forwards, conditional)

**Condition:**
* Shellcode is located at `[ESP + offset]` where -128 < offset < 127.
  
**Example:**_  
* `[ESP + 30]` → `[Shellcode]`
* `[ESP]` → `JMP 30`  
* `EIP` → `[JMP `ESP`]`  
    * `EIP` will execute a short JMP
    
* `EIP` will point to `[ESP + 30]` where the shellcode starts.  

**Pros:**
* Simple instruction.  
* Reliable, no NOP sled is needed.  

**Cons:**
* Restricted by being a short JMP.

### 8\. Hardcoded address

**Condition:**
* Shellcode is always located at specific address.  

**Example:**
* `0xdeadbeef` → `[shellcode]`  
* `EIP` → `JMP ESP`  
* `ESP` → `JMP 0xdeadbeef`
   
**Pros:**
* Simple instruction.

**Cons:**
* Unreliable.  
* Address can't contain null bytes.
