**_ As part of my prep for OSCE, I did a lot of research on backdooring PEs. I enjoyed it a lot I decided to write an exhaustive walkthrough on different backdooring techniques. Paper also covers some anti-virus bypassing techniques (didn't quite manage to get it to be FUD, but went as low as 3/60 without encryption).  
  
Feedback appreciated!
