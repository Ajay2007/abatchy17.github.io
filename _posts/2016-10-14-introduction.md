Welcome!

As an infosec junkie who likes to rant, this blog will document anything from walkthroughs (whether it being a wargame, a CTF, a cert or stuff I'm studying), researches or just rant.
Hoping to help out other people who are on the same path.

If you have questions, feel free to email me on `YmxvZ0BhYmF0Y2h5LmNvbQ==`.
