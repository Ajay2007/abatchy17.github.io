No new posts for a while now, wtf is going on?  
  
Well, I started a [new role](https://twitter.com/abatchy17/status/883517803080294402) a couple of months ago and I didn't have much time to blog (I still kind of don't), but now that security is my full time job, I have the luxury of working on topics I enjoy at work AND at home. That also means I can utilize my time better to work on things I want to do, not need to do.  
  
Like what? Two things, participating in CTFs and doing OSCE.  
  
Participating in CTFs has been on my list for quite sometime, and it's about time I get serious about it. Will I just participate in CTFs? No, I'd prefer to blog about challenges same way I did with VulnHub VMs. It's just my way of learning things, when I need to explain things to others I have to understand it properly.  
  
During the upcoming weeks I will be writing walkthroughs for [PicoCTF 2017](https://2017game.picoctf.com/), probably a post per topic/level or something. Unlike most CTF writeups, these posts will be super noob-friendly, no jumping into answers, instead demonstrate techniques on how to approach problems in each category, provide some recommended reading  material and such. A rough estimate to cover all these challenges would be ~24 weeks or so~ much longer.  
  
What about OSCE? Well I was planning on doing it in July but won't be able to commit to it. Goal is still to tackle it by end of 2017 (fingers crossed).
