No new posts for a while now, wtf is going on?  
  
Well, I started a [new role](https://twitter.com/abatchy17/status/883517803080294402) a couple of months ago and I didn't have much time to blog (I still kind of don't).

Few things I want to do / blog about in the next months:

* Participate in CTFs (hopefully write some extended guide for beginners on it)
* Get done with OSCE sometime before 2018
* Blog about kernel driver basics and exploitation techniques.

Note: I deleted last couple of posts on CTFs and might migrate them to gitbook.
