_Note: Due to an unexpected "shortcut", some changes are made. Download Moria
v1.1 below!_  
  
Moria is a standalone CentOS VM that is meant to be an intermediate to hard
boot2root VM.  
To root it you'll need solid enumeration skills, a lot of persistence and some
common sense.  
  
VM has been tested on both VMware and VirtualBox, and gets its IP through
DHCP, make sure you're on the same network.  
  
It has been submitted to Vulnhub, will update it here with the new url.  
  
**Difficulty:**| Not easy!
