<h1>About</h1> 
Thanks for being here, I hope my posts are being helpful to you.

At day I work at Microsoft on the Windows security team, at night I usually study interesting security topics and occasionaly write about them.

For questions contact me on NetSecFocus slack or YmxvZ0BhYmF0Y2h5LmNvbQo=.

_PS: Frequently I get told that my photo is of an alpacha, not a llama. Thanks for bringing that into my attention, it's getting a little insensitive. It might look like an alpacha, but deep down it's a llama._
