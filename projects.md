#### **Abstract**


Boot2root challenges aim to create a safe environment where you can perform real-world penetration testing on an (intentionally) vulnerable target.
This workshop will provide you with a custom-made VM where the goal is to obtain root level access on it. 
This is a great chance for people who want to get into pentesting but don't know where to start. *

If this sounds intimidating, don't worry! During the workshop, we'll be discussing various methodologies, common pitfalls and useful tools at every step of our pentest.

Requirements:
1. Laptop capable of running two VMs and has a USB port.
2. At least 20GB of free space.
3. VirtualBox pre-installed.
4. Kali VM
5. Some familiarity with CLI.

Virtual image will be available on USB sticks and online during the workshop and will be later published on Vulnhub.
